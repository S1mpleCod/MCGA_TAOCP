# MCGA_TAOCP
This one aims to implement algorithms in TAOCP. C++ is used with modern but explicit memory management. 

I feel sorry that people start to treat fundamental memory management, data structures, algorithms, etc., as black boxes. 

Over-relying on these black boxes lets people forget the great age when talent people were designing these algorithms. 

Besides, nowadays, people pay too much attention to big O complexity. Big O is important, definitely. However, non-dominating costs should and can also be optimised.

Luckily, we still have C++ and the art of computer programming (TAOCP). The former gives us control over memory, and the latter explains algorithms considering memory management and non-dominating costs.

Let us make C++, data structures and algorithms great again. Welcome anyone to contribute. Please propose the algorithms in TAOCP that in your domain. 

I will start with fundamental data structures in volume 1 and then jump to volumes 3 and 4 since these chapters are related to my research area.
